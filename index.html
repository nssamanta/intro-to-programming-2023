About 
I am a student currently learning Intro to Programming at Code the Dream.
I am curious to learn more about software development.
My curiosity in learning how to code came from taking a UX/UI Design and Research bootcamp.
I learned about responsive web design and used apps like Figma and InVision to prototype but I realized I could do a lot more if I knew how to code. 
Experience
At Girls Inc of Orange County I created and organized a Linktree site for volunteer and intern onboarding information.
At the UX/UI Design and Research Netflix Pathways Bootcamp I worked on redesiging the Netflix Non-Member Homepage, conducted UX research on Netflix infrequent watchers, worked on researching and redesigning the Girls Inc of Orange County site, and created my own Video Entertainment Planning App Case Study by following the UX Design process.
